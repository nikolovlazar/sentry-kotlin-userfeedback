# User Feedback in Android (Kotlin)

This repo is an implementation of Sentry's [User Feedback API](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/android/enriching-events/user-feedback/) in a sample Android (Kotlin) app.

## Running it locally
1. After you've cloned the repo, head to `app/src/main` and rename the `AndroidManifest.sample.xml` to `AndroidManifest.xml`
2. Open the new `AndroidManifest.xml` file and replace the `"[DSN_STRING]"` on line 33 with your own DSN string.
   - To obtain a DSN string, create a Sentry account at [sentry.io/signup](https://sentry.io/signup/) if you haven't already
   - Create a new Android project
   - Scroll down to the "Connecting the SDK to Sentry" section, you should see your project's DSN in the second line of the code block
3. Sync your project with the Gradle files
4. Run the app
